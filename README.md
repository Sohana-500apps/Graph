## BarGraph

Bar charts should be used to showing segments of information.

## LineGraph

Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs.

## Donut

Users can display multiple data sets with a doughnut chart. Users can place additional information about the total value or data labels in the hole of the doughnut chart.
